<p>Momo, the word itself can make any Nepali salivate, such is the savour of this food which basically is Nepal’s version of dumpling. Forget the plain, bland and boring Dal, Bhat, Tarkari and Achar because momo, our favorite go to snacks is slowly becoming a staple food in Nepali food culture, and why not?
Momo in Nepal is found in every other cafe’s and restaurants and not only that, it is cheap and yum! This traditional delicacy were initially made in a round shape with meat and vegetable stuffing but now, you can find various kind and types of momo in different shape, size and stuffing. Momo is usually served with a dipping sauce, locally called achar and are made with tomato as a base ingredient.</p>
